# Security Policy

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:**

This project follows **best-practice security**, but **cannot guarantee 100% protection** against zero-day exploits or highly targeted attacks.
For **enterprise-grade security requirements**, use **commercially supported solutions** with dedicated threat intelligence.

---

## Threat model

**Considered attack vectors** (prioritized by likelihood/risk):

1. **Command injection**
2. **Business logic bypass**
3. **Supply chain**
4. **Input sanitization bypass**
5. **Network attacks**
6. **Dependency updating**
7. **Text / formatting injection**

---

## Data sanitization

Whenever data comes from external or untrusted sources (user input, network responses, version tags, IP addresses, etc.), it is validated and sanitized before being used.

**Current protection:**

- Blocks **basic attacks**.

- May not fully prevent advanced bypasses (e.g., obfuscation).  
  *Such attacks are rare* and require deep technical knowledge to exploit.

**Limitations:**

- Filters prioritize **broad compatibility** (e.g., allow valid Unicode).

- **Admins should enforce whitelisting** for sensitive inputs (e.g., plugin for command restrictions).

**Command & argument handling:**

- Command arguments go through **lightweight validation** in the command framework (`ArgumentType`): checks for null/empty values, length limits, and basic format. They are not “sanitized” there, so that exact values (e.g., player names for `Bukkit.getPlayerExact`) remain usable as keys.

- When those values are later used at **trust boundaries** — logged, shown to players, injected into templates, or passed to external services — they are passed through `SecurityUtils` with a context-specific `SanitizeType` (e.g., `PLAYER_NAME`, `COMMAND`, `ERROR_MESSAGE`, `IP_ADDRESS`, etc.). Only these boundary points perform strong sanitization.

**Future plans:**

- Improvements to detect bypasses.

## Network Security

All external HTTP communications use TLS where possible.

The built-in `HttpUtils` wrapper enforces:

- **Timeouts**: Connection (5s), Request (10s).
- **Response limits**: Hard cap of **256 KiB** to prevent DoS via large payloads.
- **Safe JSON parsing**: Fails securely (empty `JSONObject` on errors).

---

## Symlinks in the data directory

By design, this plugin **follows symbolic links** inside its data folder for
configuration files and backups.

This allows advanced setups where configs are shared between multiple servers
(e.g. via Docker volumes or symlinked config files).

---

## Supply chain security

Every release is built via GitHub Actions with CI runner hardening enabled.
Each release artifact ships with a **SLSA Build Level 3** provenance file
and a **SHA-256 checksum** — both are published on the release page and can
be used to verify the integrity of the JAR.

### Binary artifacts in the repository

- `gradle-wrapper.jar`
  - **Location:** `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
  - **Reason it is committed:** Standard Gradle wrapper distribution mechanism, recommended by Gradle documentation.
  - **Risk mitigation:** The wrapper is pinned via `distributionSha256Sum` in `gradle-wrapper.properties`; Gradle verifies the downloaded distribution ZIP against this hash.

### Dependency locking

- Gradle dependencies
  - **Status:** **Locked**
  - **Details:** `dependencyLocking { lockAllConfigurations() }` is enabled, so all configurations are locked and upgrades are explicit.
- Gradle wrapper distribution
  - **Status:** **SHA-256 pinned**
  - **Details:** The Gradle wrapper is configured with `distributionSha256Sum` and `validateDistributionUrl=true` in `gradle-wrapper.properties`, so the Gradle distribution ZIP specified in `distributionUrl` is verified against a known SHA-256 hash and must come from `services.gradle.org`.
- GitHub Actions
  - **Status:** **Not SHA-pinned**
  - **Details:** Actions are referenced by version tags instead of commit SHAs; risk is mitigated by runtime monitoring via Harden Runner (see “CI hardening”).

---

## CI hardening

All CI jobs are protected by StepSecurity Harden Runner, which monitors
outbound network and process activity on the runner at runtime.

Third-party Actions are referenced by tag rather than commit SHA.
SHA pinning is intentionally not used — it only provides strong guarantees
when combined with manual review of every upstream commit, which this
single-developer project cannot sustain. Runtime monitoring via Harden Runner
is the primary supply-chain control instead.

---

## Security scanning

Security scans (SCA/SAST/IAST) covering the codebase, its dependencies, and the CI/GitHub Actions pipeline are run regularly: SCA/SAST checks are triggered automatically on every commit and on a daily schedule, while deeper IAST scans (using AI agents) are launched manually during major refactors or upon request.

---

## Dependency updating

Dependencies are kept up to date using [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate).

- **Regular (non-security) updates:**
  - Checked at least **weekly**.
  - A `minimumReleaseAge` of **3 days** is applied, so only versions that have been out for a while are adopted for normal updates.

- **Security-related updates:**
  - Processed **without artificial delay** — security patches are not held back by `minimumReleaseAge`.
  - Renovate security advisories and/or GitHub’s security alerts are handled as soon as possible once available.

---

## **Text / formatting injection**

- **MiniMessage**: `unparsed()` blocks dangerous tag injection from user input, preventing injection via `<click>`, `<hover>`, etc. Only trusted placeholders are parsed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use the
[Security tab](https://github.com/alex2276564/PermGuard/security/advisories) to report it privately.  
Do **not** disclose security vulnerabilities publicly before they have been addressed.
