          SnakeYAML 1.27 is only from Paper API (compileOnly, server-provided),
          and SnakeYAML 1.33 is shaded via Okaeri and used exclusively for
          trusted admin-controlled config files (no untrusted user YAML input).
          The plugin does not expose generic YAML parsing to players.
