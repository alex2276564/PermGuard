**PermGuard** is a Minecraft plugin designed to enhance server security by temporarily revoking admin permissions upon joining the server and sending security alerts to Telegram. Unlike traditional admin password plugins, which can often be bypassed through various exploits, PermGuard implements a fundamentally more secure approach by completely removing elevated permissions on join. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches, even if other security measures are compromised. When an admin with elevated permissions joins the server, their permissions are removed, and they are kicked from the server. The permissions can only be restored after the admin rejoins without the elevated permissions and manually re-grants them via the console using commands like `lp user playernick permission set *`.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Permission Revoke:** Revokes specified permissions when an admin joins.
* **Kick on Elevated Permissions:** Kicks the admin and logs the event if elevated permissions are detected.
* **Telegram Alerts:** Sends detailed security notifications to Telegram, including information about the player, their IP address, and country.
* **Manual Permission Restoration:** Admins must rejoin without elevated permissions and restore them manually via console commands.
* **Customizable Kick Messages:** You can personalize the message shown to admins when they are kicked.
* **Logging:** Logs all permission revocation events to both the console and a file for auditing.
* **Reload Command:** Allows reloading the configuration without restarting the server.
* **Lightweight and Efficient:** Designed to have minimal impact on server performance.
* **Shutdown Protection:** If the plugin is disabled (e.g., through Plugman), the server will automatically shut down to ensure no security gaps are left open.
* **Auto-Update Check:** On server start, the plugin checks for updates. If a new version is available, a notification is displayed in the console.
* **Modern Text Rendering:** Uses Adventure MiniMessage for sleek formatting on supported servers (Paper 1.18+), with automatic fallback on older versions.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Benefits

### How PermGuard Protects Against Advanced Attacks:

1. **Brute Force Attacks:** By removing permissions upon login, it prevents unauthorized access even if someone gains temporary access to an admin account.
2. **Account Compromise:** If an admin's account is compromised, the attacker won't be able to abuse their permissions as they will be revoked upon joining.
3. **Session Hijacking:** Mitigates the risk of session hijacking by ensuring that permissions are not persistently available during a hijacked session.
4. **Social Engineering:** Reduces the risk of admins being tricked into giving away their permissions.
5. **Unknown Vulnerabilities:** Helps mitigate the risks associated with unknown vulnerabilities by limiting the potential damage an attacker can do, even if they find a way to bypass other security measures.
6. **Port Exploitation / BungeeCord Hacks:** By revoking admin permissions on entry, PermGuard minimizes the potential for attackers to exploit server ports or use BungeeCord-related hacks to gain elevated privileges.
7. **AuthMe Bypass:** Even if an attacker finds a way to bypass AuthMe authentication, they won't gain immediate access to admin permissions as PermGuard will revoke them upon entry.
8. **Zero-Day Exploits:** Provides a safety net against zero-day exploits by ensuring that even if a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker will not have sustained access to admin permissions.
9. **Telegram Alerts:** If a suspicious activity is detected, detailed notifications are sent to Telegram, including the player's IP and country, so you can take immediate action.
10. **Shutdown Protection:** Ensures that if the plugin is disabled , the server shuts down to prevent any security gaps from being exploited.

### Compliance with Security Standards:

**Note:** The following compliance features are implemented within the PermGuard plugin itself. Your server's overall security compliance depends on your complete infrastructure setup, proper configuration of all components, and following security best practices across your entire system.

- **Least Privilege Principle (ISO/IEC 15408):** Ensures that users have only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of privilege abuse.
- **Audit Logging (ISO/IEC 27001):** Provides detailed logs of all permission-related activities, facilitating compliance audits and forensic analysis.
- **ISO/IEC 27001 Compliance:** PermGuard helps servers adhere to information security management best practices by enforcing strict permission controls and audit logging.
- **CIS Controls:** Aligns with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls for effective cyber defense by implementing strong access control measures.
- **Secure Access Control:** By requiring manual permission restoration via the console, PermGuard ensures that only authorized personnel can grant elevated privileges.

## üì• Installation

1. **Download:** Download the latest version of PermGuard from the [Releases](https://github.com/alex2276564/PermGuard/releases) page.
2. **Install:** Place the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder.
3. **Restart:** Restart your server to load the plugin.

## üìú Commands

PermGuard supports both the full command `/permguard` and the shorter alias `/pg` for all commands (requires `permguard.command` permission).

- `/permguard reload` - Reloads the plugin configuration (requires `permguard.reload` permission)

## üõ†Ô∏è Compatibility

- **Minecraft Versions:** 1.16.5 to the latest release
- **Server Software:** [Paper](https://papermc.io/) (1.16.5 and newer)

## üìù Note

**Security Implementation Design:** PermGuard uses `PlayerJoinEvent` instead of `PlayerLoginEvent` by design. This ensures that no other plugin can accidentally or intentionally override our security checks. With `PlayerJoinEvent`, once we detect restricted permissions and kick the player, the action cannot be cancelled or overridden by other plugins, providing maximum security guarantee. Why not PlayerLoginEvent? Although `PlayerLoginEvent` would prevent the player from appearing in the tab list, other plugins with higher priority could potentially `allow()` the connection after our `disallow()`, creating a security vulnerability.

**AxiomPaper Compatibility:** This plugin may interfere with the AxiomPaper plugin's functionality. AxiomPaper only checks permissions when a player joins the server, so if you remove all permissions and then restore them while in-game, the Axiom mod will not work properly. To make PermGuard and Axiom work together, you can grant yourself the `axiom.*` permission on your account (and configure PermGuard not to remove it) to ensure both plugins function correctly.

**Performance Optimization:** PermGuard checks permissions synchronously during the player join event. For optimal performance, avoid adding unnecessary permissions to the configuration file. Remove any permissions that you don't actually need to monitor. For most admin accounts, you can simply use the wildcard permission `*` instead of listing multiple individual permissions, as this provides comprehensive protection while maintaining efficiency.

**Native MiniMessage Support:** Plugin uses only native Kyori Adventure MiniMessage implementation without any backporting or compatibility layers:

- **Paper 1.18+:** Full native MiniMessage support with all features including gradients, hover effects, click events, and advanced formatting
- **Paper 1.16-1.17:** Partial support with automatic conversion to legacy ChatColor codes. Supported features include basic colors (`<red>`, `<blue>`, etc.), text styles (`<bold>`, `<italic>`, `<underlined>`, `<strikethrough>`, `<obfuscated>`), and reset tags (`<reset>`). Advanced features like gradients and hover effects are automatically stripped without causing errors.

‚ö†Ô∏è However, on supported forks that update Adventure libraries (such as ShieldSpigot or similar actively maintained 1.16.x‚Äì1.17.x forks), full MiniMessage support may be available even on legacy versions, if the net.kyori.adventure.text.minimessage.MiniMessage class is present and compatible. In such cases, the plugin will automatically detect and enable native formatting features as it does on modern servers.

You can use the [MiniMessage Web Editor](https://webui.advntr.dev/) to test and preview your formatting. The plugin will automatically adapt the formatting to your server's capabilities, so you can use the same configuration across different server versions.
