# 📝 PermGuard Configuration
#
# 💬 Text messages in this config file support MiniMessage formatting!
#     → Works best with Paper 1.18+
#     → Older versions automatically fallback to legacy color formatting
#     → Examples: <red>Alert!</red>, <bold><yellow>Warning</yellow></bold>,
#                  <gradient:red:yellow>Hello</gradient>
#     → Use the web editor: https://webui.advntr.dev/
