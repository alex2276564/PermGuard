/**
 * String utility class for processing escape sequences manually.
 *
 * This class is necessary because we moved away from default Bukkit configuration methods.
 * Bukkit's YamlConfiguration automatically processes escape sequences when loading strings
 * from YAML files, but since we're using custom configuration handling, we lost that "magic"
 * and now need to process escape sequences manually.
 *
 * Without this processing, strings like "Line 1\nLine 2" would be displayed literally
 * as "Line 1\nLine 2" instead of being split into two lines.
